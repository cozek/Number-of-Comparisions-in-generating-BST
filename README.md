# Number-of-Comparisions-in-generating-BST

Take a positive integer (say K) as an input from the user. Generate all the K! BST from numbers
{1,2,â€¦,K}. For each generated BST, calculate the number of comparisons between the numbers
required to generate that particular BST.


## Sample Input/Output:
Enter a positive integer K = 3<br>
Total number of generated BST = 6<br>
Number of comparisons required to generate BST from permutations &lt;1,2,3&gt; = 3<br>
Number of comparisons required to generate BST from permutations &lt;1,3,2&gt; = 3<br>
Number of comparisons required to generate BST from permutations &lt;2,1,3&gt; = 2<br>
Number of comparisons required to generate BST from permutations &lt;2,3,1&gt; = 2<br>
Number of comparisons required to generate BST from permutations &lt;3,1,2&gt; = 3<br>
Number of comparisons required to generate BST from permutations &lt;3,2,1&gt; = 3<br>
